Strange Place

You wake up in a strange place. You can't remember how you got here and your name. You feel little bit
dizzy. Place looks like prison cell. You can hear voices behind the door, but you can't understand the words.
Sun from little window under the ceil illuminates grey bad and dirty toilet. You hear footsteps behind
door, with every step you squeeze into the bed. In a few seconds door opens and in a doorway you see 
an old man in military uniform. He gives you a bag with clothes inside and leaves.

Wear form.

Shout at the old man.
